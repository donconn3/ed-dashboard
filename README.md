# ed-dashboard
WIP - A dashboard using Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML that connects to NASA API, NOAA API, and more (in the future).

The main goal is to have a personal dashboard that will give me a new picture from NASA, display the current weather of the city I search, give me a forecast
for that city, display my calendar and "sticky notes" of tasks that follow CRUD.

The idea is to run this on a local server to access privately or run on my phone as an app.
